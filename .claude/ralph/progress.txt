# ERP Development Progress

## 2026-01-23 - P0-BE-001: Backend Scaffolding Complete

### Completed
- **P0-BE-001**: 项目脚手架搭建 (Go Module, 目录结构)

### What was done
1. Created Go module at `backend/` with `github.com/erp/backend`
2. Established DDD directory structure:
   - `cmd/server/` - HTTP server entry point
   - `internal/domain/` - Domain layer with bounded contexts (catalog, partner, inventory, trade, finance, shared)
   - `internal/application/` - Application services (placeholder)
   - `internal/infrastructure/` - Infrastructure (config, persistence, eventbus)
   - `internal/interfaces/http/` - HTTP handlers, DTOs, middleware
   - `migrations/` - Database migrations (empty, ready for P0-BE-004)
   - `tests/` - Unit and integration test directories

3. Installed dependencies:
   - gin-gonic/gin (HTTP framework)
   - gorm.io/gorm + postgres driver (ORM)
   - google/uuid (UUIDs)
   - shopspring/decimal (precise decimals)
   - go-playground/validator/v10 (validation)
   - uber/zap (logging, not yet configured)
   - spf13/viper (config, not yet integrated)
   - golang-jwt/jwt/v5 (authentication)
   - redis/go-redis/v9 (cache/queue)
   - testify (testing)

4. Created shared domain components:
   - `BaseEntity` and `BaseAggregateRoot` with version for optimistic locking
   - `TenantAggregateRoot` for multi-tenant support
   - `DomainEvent` interface and `BaseDomainEvent`
   - `Repository` generic interface with `Filter` and `Paginated` types
   - Common domain errors (NotFound, AlreadyExists, InvalidState, etc.)

5. Created HTTP infrastructure:
   - Unified response format (`dto/response.go`)
   - Base handler with error handling (`handler/base.go`)
   - Common middleware (CORS, RequestID, Logger)
   - Health check and ping endpoints

### Files created
- `backend/go.mod`, `backend/go.sum`
- `backend/cmd/server/main.go`
- `backend/internal/domain/shared/*.go` (5 files)
- `backend/internal/domain/{catalog,partner,inventory,trade,finance}/doc.go`
- `backend/internal/infrastructure/config/config.go`
- `backend/internal/interfaces/http/dto/response.go`
- `backend/internal/interfaces/http/handler/base.go`
- `backend/internal/interfaces/http/middleware/common.go`
- `backend/README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`

### Build Status
- `go build ./...` passes successfully

### Notes for next developer
- P0-BE-002 (Database connection) depends on this and can now be started
- P0-BE-003 (Logger config) depends on this and can now be started
- Config currently uses env vars directly; may integrate Viper in P0-BE-003
- Main server is functional but minimal - add routes as APIs are developed
- Shared kernel is ready for value objects (P0-BE-005)

## 2026-01-23 - P0-BE-002: Database Connection Configuration Complete

### Completed
- **P0-BE-002**: 数据库连接配置 (PostgreSQL)

### What was done
1. Created database connection module at `internal/infrastructure/persistence/database.go`:
   - `Database` struct wrapping GORM DB instance
   - `NewDatabase()` and `NewDatabaseWithLogger()` constructors
   - Connection pool configuration (MaxOpenConns, MaxIdleConns, ConnMaxLifetime, ConnMaxIdleTime)
   - `Close()`, `Ping()`, `Stats()` methods for connection management
   - `Transaction()` method for transactional operations
   - `WithTenant()` method for multi-tenant scoping (with empty tenant ID validation)

2. Enhanced configuration with validation:
   - Added `ConnMaxLifetime` and `ConnMaxIdleTime` config options
   - Added production-specific validation (JWT secret, DB password, SSL mode)
   - Added connection pool validation (MaxIdleConns <= MaxOpenConns)
   - Changed DSN format to URL-style for proper escaping of special characters

3. Integrated database into main server:
   - Database connection on startup with graceful close on shutdown
   - Health check endpoint now returns proper HTTP 503 when database is unhealthy
   - Database status included in health response

4. Security improvements:
   - Production requires JWT secret (min 32 chars), DB password, and SSL enabled
   - Empty tenant ID in `WithTenant()` panics to prevent data leakage
   - DSN uses URL encoding to handle special characters in passwords

5. Test coverage:
   - Unit tests for `Database` struct methods using sqlmock
   - Tests for `ConnectionStats` struct
   - Tests for `WithTenant` including SQL injection prevention
   - Tests for `Transaction` with commit and rollback scenarios
   - Config validation tests for both development and production modes
   - DSN generation tests including special character escaping

### Files created/modified
- `backend/internal/infrastructure/persistence/database.go` (new)
- `backend/internal/infrastructure/persistence/database_test.go` (new)
- `backend/internal/infrastructure/config/config.go` (enhanced with validation)
- `backend/internal/infrastructure/config/config_test.go` (new)
- `backend/cmd/server/main.go` (integrated database)
- `backend/.env.example` (added new config options)

### Build Status
- `go build ./...` passes successfully
- `go test ./...` passes all tests

### Notes for next developer
- P0-BE-003 (Logger config) can now be started - integrate zap with database logging
- P0-BE-004 (Database migrations) can now be started - database connection is ready
- The `NewDatabaseWithLogger()` function allows custom log levels for debugging
- `WithTenant()` requires non-empty tenant ID - use in middleware after auth
- For integration tests, use testcontainers-go to spin up PostgreSQL
- Health endpoint at `/health` includes database status
